# Coding Challenge: Astrafy

## Task Description

You will build a document processing pipeline demonstrating your ability to work with
Large Language Models (LLMs), orchestrate multi-step AI workflows, and integrate wi
cloud services.

### Objectives

Create a LangGraph pipeline that processes academic research papers (PDFs) to extract
and structure key information, ultimately storing it in BigQuery for analysis. The pipeline
should demonstrate your ability to:

* Work with LangGraph for LLM orchestration
* Handle document processing
* Implement structured data extraction
* Work with Google Cloud Platform
* Write clean, maintainable code

### Requirements
**Document Ingestion**
* Accept PDF research papers as input
* Extract raw text while maintaining document structure

**Information Extraction**:
* Extract basic metadata (title, authors, publication date, abstract)
* Identify and extract key research findings and methodology
* Generate structured summaries and keywords

**Data Storage**:
* Design a BigQuery schema to store the extracted information
* Implement data loading to BigQuery
